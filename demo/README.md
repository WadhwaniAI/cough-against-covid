## Demo Notebooks

We have added two notebooks to demo a sample model run (using the models used in the ICLR'21 Workshop Paper) on a sample cough and contextual data to get COVID detection results. These notebooks can also be used to make predictions using input audio and contextual data as provided by the user.

- For Cough Data : `covid_detection_from_cough.ipynb`
- For Contextual Data : `covid_detection_from_contextual.ipynb`
