### Datasets: Downloading, cleaning and versioning

This section has code and instructions for downloading and setting up a dataset for usage (training, inference etc.). For a given dataset, say our own dataset named `wiai-facility`, you need to follow the steps given below. As an example, we show instructions to download and setup the [CoSwara Dataset](https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data) by IISc, Bangalore.

1. **Download**: You can follow the instructions in `download/wiai-facility/` to download and store the dataset in a folder structure as instructed.
2. **Cleaning**: For every dataset, we have a `raw/` folder that stores the audio files in the format of the original dataset. In order to standardise the storage, we keep a `processed/` folder where we store a flat-list of all audio files contained in `raw/`.
3. **Versioning**: Once steps 1 and 2 are done, you can use the code in `versioning/` to create dataset version files. This is an important step and needs carefully attention. For example, if you want to split a dataset randomly into train, validation and test, you can use `XXX` notebook and save it as version `v1.0`. If you want to create a new (different) split of the *same* samples as in `v1.0`, then create `v1.1` and so on. If you decide to add more samples to the original dataset, then you should create `v2.0` and so on.
