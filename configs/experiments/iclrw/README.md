### ICLR'21 Workshop Paper Configs

We have added the experiment configs that we used for the ICLR'21 [AI For Public Health](https://aiforpublichealth.github.io/) Workshop paper. We had three different splits on which we evaluated our models (`v9.4` : Time Based Split, `v9.7` : Site based split, `v9.8` : Random Split). The best configs for each of these splits across two input modalities (cough and context) are:

#### Context Model Configs
1. v9.4 : `experiments/iclrw/context/v9.4/context-neural.yml`
2. v9.7 : `experiments/iclrw/context/v9.4/context-neural.yml`
3. v9.8 : `experiments/iclrw/context/v9.4/context-neural.yml`

#### Cough Model Configs
1. v9.4 : `experiments/iclrw/cough/v9.4/adamW_1e-4_cyclic.yml`
2. v9.7 : `experiments/iclrw/cough/v9.7/adamW_1e-4.yml`
3. v9.8 : `experiments/iclrw/cough/v9.8/adamW_1e-4.yml`
